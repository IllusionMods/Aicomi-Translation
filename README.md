# Aicomi-Translation
Fan translations for Aicomi, for use with [XUnity Auto Translator](https://github.com/bbepis/XUnity.AutoTranslator)

Releases must be made with the TranslationTool included in this repository, or some ADV dialogue lines will not be translated in-game. This is because the tool has to generate regexes for lines with placeholder tags that represent character names in-game.
